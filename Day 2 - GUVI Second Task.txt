Difference between document and windows object.

Document: 

     Document is the entry point into the DOM (Ex) document.querySelector().

     DOM means Documnet object model and it is a structured representation os HTML document. The DOM allows us to use Javascript to access HTML element and style in order to access
HTML element and style in order to manipulate them.
     
     EG :- Change Text, HTML attribute and even CSS styles from our Javascript.

     DOM automatically created by the browser as soon as the HTM page loads and it is stored in tree structured. The DOM is a complete representation of the HTML document.
     
     DOM is not part of Javascript. DOM properties and methods to manipulate the DOM is not part of javascript.The javascript comes from ECMA script and all the DOM releated 
stuff not in the ECMA Script.


Windows:

     As we know document is represtation of HTML but window is the above the level or parent for that document technically document is inside the window only.
     
     For Example:
            
         In console window.document and this document is same only both indicates the HTML document.
        
         And not only document there are many other objects is also there in windows like alert, prompt and console is also a object.
